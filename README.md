# Campus-finder Backend

This repository contains the backend code for Campus Finder, a platform that helps students find and explore various schools, colleges, and investors. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB and utilizes various npm packages for its functionality. The backend provides features like user authentication, review management, profile editing, and CRUD APIs for colleges and schools. Additionally, certain features are restricted to the admin only, such as deleting or inserting colleges and schools, as well as editing existing entries.

## Getting Started

To use this backend, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project repository using the following command:`git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required packages:`npm i`
3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. Inside the .env file, add the following **env variables**:`PORT=`,<br>`CONNECTION_STRING=YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, <br>`JWT_SECRET=`, <br>`JWT_EXPIRE=`, <br>`COOKIE_EXPIRE=`
4. After setting up the .env file and installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running:
**`npm start`**.

The API should now be up and running, ready to serve incoming requests.

## Key Features:
* **User Authentication**: Implementing a secure user authentication system to enable users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features.

* **Profile Editing**: Allowing users to modify their profile information, making it easier to keep their details up to date.

* **Personalized Wishlist**: Enabling users to create a personalized wishlist by adding their favorite colleges and schools, allowing for easy access and organization of preferred choices.

* **Review Management**: Facilitating users to post, view, and manage reviews for different schools and colleges, contributing to an informed decision-making process.

* **Powerful CRUD APIs**: Providing Create, Read, Update, and Delete APIs to manage colleges and schools, ensuring efficient data management.

* **Admin Privileges**: Limiting certain functionalities, such as adding, deleting, or editing entries, to the admin role to maintain data integrity.
Search Feature: Allowing users to search through different colleges and schools based on various criteria, such as location, programs offered, and other relevant information. This feature enhances the platform's usability and helps users find the institutions that best suit their needs.
